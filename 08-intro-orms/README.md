## Database and SQL Review with Books and Authors üèó

*What does the design philosophy of* Domain Modeling *look like in a relational database?*

**1. Create a *books* table and an *authors* table. Books should have a *title* and authors should have a *name*.**

**books table**

**authors table**

**2. Create a *books* table and an *authors* table where each author can have one or multiple books. Books should have a *title* and authors should have a *name*.**

**books table**

| id | title |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The Sympathizer |
| 2 | Ready Player One |
| 3 | Men Explain Things to Me |
| 4 | A Field Guild to Getting Lost |

**book_authors (join) table**

| id | book_id | author_id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 4 | 1 |

**authors table**

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Rebecca Solnit |
| 2 | Ernest Cline |
| 3 | Viet Thanh Nguyen |

**3. Write the SQL to find all books written by a certain author given the author's id.**

```SQL
SELECT * FROM books
INNER JOIN books_authors ON books_authors.book_id == books.id
INNER JOIN authors ON authors.id == book_authors.author_id
WHERE author.id == 1;
```

## CRUD üé®

*What are the four ways we can interact with data? What might this interaction look like in SQL? In Ruby?*

**Create**

- `INSERT INTO books (title) values ('War and Peace');`
- book = Book.new({'title' => 'War and Peace})

**Read**

- `SELECT * FROM books;`
- `Book.all`

**Update**

- `UPDATE books SET title = 'Ana Karenina' WHERE id == 5;`
- `book.update({'title' => 'Ana Karenina'})

**Destroy**

- `DELETE FROM books WHERE id == 5;`
- `book.delete`

## The Active Record Pattern üß©

- The Active Record Pattern is an approach to accessing data in a database using object-oriented programming.
- A **database** corresponds to a **domain**.
- Each **table** in the database corresponds to a Ruby **class** (model).
- Each **row** in a table corresponds to an **instance** of that model.
- Each **column** in our table corresponds to an **attribute** of that model.

## DO THE THING üç≠

### Why? ü§î

*Problem*: Data is *not persistent*. Ruby stores data in memory. 
*Solution*: Relational database saved, accessed, and altered in `.db` file.

### Examine structure and tooling üõ†

- `run.rb` file in `./bin`
- Outsourced reqs in `./config/environment.rb`
    - *What is namespacing of SQLite3?*
    - SQLite3 module with Database class
- Store database file in `./db/database_name.db`
- `./lib` contains classes
- Gemfile(.lock) helps manage dependencies
    - Bundler is a gem which manages other gems
    - `bundle init` creates a Gemfile
    - `bundle install` installs gems
    - Gemfile lists required gems and source
    - Gemfile.lock records installed gems *and* dependencies
- Rakefile
    - Rake is a task runner!
    - `rake -T` shows tasks
    - `rake task_name` runs task
    - `rake console` better than `irb` because it contains program information

### Wrap SQL in Ruby üç¨

- Guidelines
    - Execute SQL command in method
    - Return Object instead of Enumerable
- Create methods
    - `@id` attribute
    - `#save` a tweet
- Helper methods
    - `#in_db?`
    - `#set_instance_id`
- Read methods
    - Get `.all` tweets!
    - Return class instances instead of hashes from database
    - `.find_by_id`
- Update method
    - `#update` with object attribute
    - ActiveRecord gem will help with `#save` management
- Delete
    - `.delete_all` from array, db
    - `#delete` 
- ***WARNING*** SQL Injection!
    - [Little Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/)
    - Parameterize SQL calls to defend!

### For your edification... ü¶ú

- [ ] **A tweet belongs to a user and has some message content - must have user_id**
- [ ] **The belongs_to must have a user_id on it**
- [ ] **A user has a username, and has many tweets**
- [ ] **A tweet can have many tags and a tag can have many tweets**

## Takeaways

- [x] A domain model can be directly mapped to a database with the Active Record pattern.
- [x] There are four ways to interact with data: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
- [x] SQL queries can executed with Ruby to interface a programmatical model with a database.
